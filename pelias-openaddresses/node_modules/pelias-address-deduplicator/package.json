  "readme": "# address deduplicator\nA stream that performs address deduplication using the robust\n[OpenVenues deduplicator](https://github.com/openvenues/address_deduper); note that it must be separately installed and\nrunning.\n\n## API\n`pelias-address-deduplicator` exports a single function:\n`createDeduplicateStream( requestBatchSize, maxLiveRequests, serverUrl )`, which accepts three optional arguments:\n\n  * `requestBatchSize` (default: `10000`): The number of addresses to buffer into a\n    batch before sending it to the deduplicator. The higher the number, the\n    less time and energy collectively spent in making requests, but the\n    bigger the memory consumption buildup.\n  * `maxLiveRequests` (default: `4`): Since the deduper is implemented as a\n    standalone server and processes data more slowly than the importer feeds\n    it, the stream needs to rate-limit itself. `maxLiveRequests` indicates\n    the maximum number of unresolved concurrent requests at any time; when\n    that number is hit, the stream will pause reading until the number of\n    concurrent requests falls below it.\n  * `serverUrl` (default: `'http://localhost:5000'`): The HTTP base URL of the address deduplicator server.\n\nand returns a `Transform` stream, which accepts un-deduplicated addresses and filters out the duplicates; note that\nit'll likely be the slowest part of your data pipeline because of all the involved heavy lifting. The addresses\nthemselves are expected to be [pelias/model](https://github.com/pelias/model) `Document` objects.\n",
