  "readme": "# Who's On First Admin Lookup\n\nThis repository is part of the [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias)\nproject. Pelias is an open-source, open-data geocoder built by\n[Mapzen](https://www.mapzen.com/) that also powers [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search). Our\nofficial user documentation is [here](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/).\n\n## Overview\n\n### What is admin lookup?\n\nWhen collecting data for use in a [geocoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding),\nit's obviously important to know which city, country, etc each record belongs\nto. Collectively we call these fields the admin heirarchy.\n\nNot every data source contains this information, and even those that do don't\nalways have it consistently. So, for Pelias we actually ignore _all_ admin\nheirarchy information from individual records, and generate it ourselves from\nthe polygon data in [Who's on First](http://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/). This\nprocess is called admin lookup.\n\n### How does admin lookup work?\n\nAdmin lookup is essentially [reverse geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding):\ngiven the latitude and longitude of a point, populate the admin heiarchy by\nfinding all the polygons for countries, cities, neighborhoods, and other admin\nfields that contain the point.\n\n### Are there any downsides?\n\nThere are two: admin lookup slows down the process of loading data into Pelias,\nand it takes quite a bit of memory. Based on the current amount of data in Who's\non First, count on using at least 4 or 5 GB of memory _just_ for admin lookup\nwhile importing.\n\nFor these reasons, each of our importers has a configuration option to enable or\ndisable admin lookup.\n",
